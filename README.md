Kaggle Competition Project: Building an AI to Predict Who Survived the Titanic
Questions:
1. Explain how the quality of a model is calculated for a classification problem: name the primary and secondary metrics, give an example.
2. What is a test set and why is it needed?
3. What is the difference between a model parameter and a hyperparameter of a learning algorithm? Give examples.
Kaggle Competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/
The competition is simple: use machine learning to build a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic.

The plan:
1. Introduction to the data
2. EDA
3. Feature selection
4. Modeling
5. Prediction + summary
